Write a C++ graphics program to:

1. Draw a circle using Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm.

2. Draw an equilateral triangle inscribed inside the circle using the DDA Line Drawing Algorithm.

3. Calculate and draw the incircle (inner circle) of the triangle by computing the incenter and inradius using coordinate geometry and Heronâ€™s formula.

The program should visually demonstrate geometric construction and use efficient pixel plotting for both lines and circles.
