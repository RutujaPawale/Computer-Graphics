Write a C++ program using graphics.h to simulate the bouncing motion of a ball using a sine wave. The program should:

1. Use a base class Shape with a pure virtual draw() function to demonstrate polymorphism.

2. Define a derived class Ball that overrides the draw() method to animate the vertical bouncing motion using the sine function.

3. Move the ball horizontally across the screen while it bounces vertically.

4. Reset the ballâ€™s position once it crosses the right edge of the screen.

5. Draw the ground line as a visual base reference.

6. Use animation logic with delay and screen refresh for a smooth motion.
