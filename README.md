🎨 Computer Graphics Programs in C++ (Turbo C++ / graphics.h)
This repository contains a curated collection of Computer Graphics programs written in C++ using the graphics.h library. Each program demonstrates various fundamental and advanced graphics algorithms, object transformations, animations, and visual simulations — ideal for students, hobbyists, and engineering projects.

📁 Repository Structure
The code is organized into topic-wise folders, including:

1. 2D Transformations – Translation, Scaling, Rotation using matrix multiplication.

2. Animations – Bouncing ball using sine wave, man walking in rain, sunrise-sunset, etc.

3. Classic Algorithms – DDA Line Drawing, Bresenham Circle Drawing.

4. Fractals – Koch Snowflake, Hilbert Curve (recursive curve generation).

5. Polygon Fill – Scanline polygon filling technique for irregular shapes.

6. Creative Simulations – Umbrella rain animation, natural scenes with moving elements.
