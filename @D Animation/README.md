Write a C program using the Turbo C++ graphics library (<graphics.h>) to create an animation of a man walking with an umbrella while it is raining. The man should move continuously from left to right, reset his position when he reaches the edge of the screen, and raindrops should fall randomly across the window.

1. Draw the man with a head, body, legs, and arms.

2. Add an umbrella above the manâ€™s head.

3. Simulate rain by drawing multiple short vertical lines at random positions.

4. Use cleardevice() to refresh frames and delay() to control animation speed.
