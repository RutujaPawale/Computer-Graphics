Write a C++ program using the graphics.h library to perform 2D geometric transformations on a polygon. The program should:

1. Accept the number of vertices and their coordinates from the user.

2. Display the original polygon.

3. Provide a menu to perform one of the following transformations using matrix multiplication:

   -Translation (user inputs tx and ty)

    -Scaling (user inputs sx and sy)

    -Rotation (user inputs angle of rotation)

4. Display the transformed polygon along with the original.

5. Use homogeneous coordinates and implement the transformation using operator overloading.
